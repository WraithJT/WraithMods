﻿This is my personal mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

## Changes
* Classes
	* Alchemist
		* Modifies Incense Synthesizer Incense Fog to have a base range of 30 feet, adds some visual and sound effects, and removes the "Incense Fog - Increased Range" option from level up choices.
*  Abilities
	* Judgment
		* Currently modifies all Judgment abilities to be activatable outside of combat. Future state should limit this to characters with the Everlasting Judgment Mythic Ability.
